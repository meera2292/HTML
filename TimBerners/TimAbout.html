                                Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England,[26] the eldest of the four 
                                children of Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is a professor 
                                of ecology and climate change management. His parents were computer scientists who 
                                worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended 
                                Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south-west London's Emanuel 
                                School from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became 
                                an independent school in 1975.[1][20] A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt 
                                about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[27] He studied at The Queen's 
                                College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class Bachelor of Arts
                                 degree in physics.[1][26] While at university, Berners-Lee made a computer out of 
                                 an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop.
