                        A waterfall is a point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of <b>steep</b> drops. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular <b>iceberg</b> or ice shelf.
                    <p>

                    <p>  
                        Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a <b>river courses</b> over a top layer of resistant bedrock before <b>falling on to softer rock, which erodes faster</b>, leading to an increasingly high fall. Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species living in and around them.
