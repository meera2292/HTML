                            Kerala was a relatively unknown state among tourist circles until the early 1960s. 
                            The first initiative to popularize Kerala as a tourist destination was undertaken by 
                            Travancore's Prince Consort Col. Godavarma Raja (husband of the then Queen of Travancore) 
                            started Kerala Tours Limited to popularize key tourist locations in Travancore Kingdom. 
                            When Travancore merged with India, Kerala Tours Limited became a private entity under the 
                            Travancore royal family. For more than 20 years since Independence, Kerala trend to ignore
                             tourism as a key industry, leaving KTL and other private players to lead the role. In the 1960s,
                              KTL struck gold, by collaborating with Thomas Cook and started popularizing Kovalam in western 
                              countries which started the advent of hippie culture in Kovalam Beach. The strong inflow of 
                              tourists into Kovalam, started Kerala government to consider tourism as a key industry. Though 
                              it tried to nationalize Kerala Tours Limited, it soon fell into legal issues. This resulted in 
                              the government to think starting a new entity known as Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) IN 1966.[1]
